# MEMPI-energy-management-system

This repo contains the survey questionnaire that was used in the "Harnessing Smart Meter Data for a Multitiered Energy Management Performance Indicators (MEMPI) Framework: A Facility Manager Informed Approach" paper (under review for the Applied Energy journal). We will be updating this repo with other supplemental information that will help researchers gain a more in-depth understanding of our work.
